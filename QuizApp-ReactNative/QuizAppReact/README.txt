App.js
- I worked a lot with this page to ensure the overall routing of the app was cohesive (with the back button implementation) and ensuring the development of our new splash screen feature

Created components directory
- this holds every single page that we work with
- the purpose of this directory is so that all the work that we do is consolidated into one area
- I made sure to include this organization this time around so that we don't run into similar problems that we did in previous years

------------ Inside /components
HomeScreen.js
- This is the main Home Screen that I worked on. It acts as a central nexus for all the features that I worked on with my team this semester

LoginPage.js
- This is the intro page that is shown on boot up / new registration for the application. This time around, we made sure to tie the login information to a cloud storage rather than a locally booted database

Menu.js
- This is the menu page which lets you navigate to whatever feature page you might want to go to

Search.js
- This is the search page. I worked on outlining the default structure for this feature and then made sure the implementation was completed with the help of other developers

Settings.js
- This was the settings page. I spearheaded the development of all the features on this page and employed the help of other members in my team to continue finishing whatever implementation ideas I had in mind,

FlashCard.js
- Worked on the flashcard feature through this page. There is still work that needs to be done here to perfect the implementations

------------------ Inside /iOS
- I worked a lot with the Podfile and ensuring that I used Cocoa Pods to download the right dependencies and packages for this application
